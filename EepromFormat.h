/**  
 * If the eeprom data is not initialized or is not the same version as expected, all chambers go until the valid data is provided. This is done by making the default mode offline. 
 * The external script will either reset the eeprom settings or manage the upgrade between versions. 
 * Note that this is typically only necessary after flashing new firmware, which is usually watched by an operator.
 * If the arduino restarts after a power failure, the settings will have been upgraded
 * and operation can continue from the saved settings.
